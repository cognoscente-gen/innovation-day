## Ideal Rounding Solution in Java

Here's an ideal solution for rounding data in Java using a library:

**1. Library Implementation:**

* Create a `RoundingUtil` class with static methods for rounding.
* Offer methods for different rounding modes (up, down, half-up):

```java
public class RoundingUtil {

    public static double roundUp(double value, int decimalPlaces) {
        return Math.ceil(value * Math.pow(10, decimalPlaces)) / Math.pow(10, decimalPlaces);
    }

    public static double roundDown(double value, int decimalPlaces) {
        return Math.floor(value * Math.pow(10, decimalPlaces)) / Math.pow(10, decimalPlaces);
    }

    public static double roundHalfUp(double value, int decimalPlaces) {
        return Math.round(value * Math.pow(10, decimalPlaces)) / Math.pow(10, decimalPlaces);
    }
}
```

* Consider using `BigDecimal` for higher precision if needed.

**2. Configuration:**

* Avoid configuration files for simplicity.
* Define default rounding mode (e.g., half-up) within the library.
* Allow overriding the default mode through method arguments.

**3. Team Mercury Use Case:**

* Implement a separate method in `RoundingUtil` for percentage rounding. This method can sum the rounded values and adjust the last value to reach 100%.

**4. Audit Trail:**

* Create an `AuditTrail` class to store rounding information.
* Include fields like original value, rounded value, rounding mode, timestamp, etc.
* Persist audit data to DynamoDB or a relational database (consider cost and access patterns).
* Implement methods in `RoundingUtil` to log audit information when rounding occurs.

**5. Lambda vs. Class:**

* While a lambda could achieve rounding logic, a class offers better maintainability, reusability, and documentation.

**Cost and Time Considerations:**

* This approach is relatively lightweight and cost-effective.
* Development time is minimized by using existing Java methods and avoiding complex configuration files.

**Title: Consistent Data Rounding with RoundingUtil Library**

**Introduction:**

This document outlines the implementation of a `RoundingUtil` library for consistent data rounding across our systems.

**Problem:**

Inconsistent rounding practices led to data discrepancies in distributed data.

**Solution:**

* A centralized `RoundingUtil` class offers methods for various rounding modes (up, down, half-up) with user-selectable decimal places.
* The library facilitates consistent rounding across applications and eliminates the need for individual consumer-specific logic.
* Team Mercury's use case is addressed with a dedicated percentage rounding method.

**Audit Trail:**

* Optional audit trail functionality logs rounding details for historical reference and compliance purposes.

**Benefits:**

* Consistency in data distribution across all channels.
* Improved client experience by eliminating rounding discrepancies.
* Reduced development effort due to a centralized library.

**Implementation Details:**

* The document can include code snippets and explanations of the `RoundingUtil` class and its methods.
* It can discuss the audit trail implementation (if chosen) and data storage considerations.

## Audit Log Table Structure

| Field           | Description                                           | Data Type          |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| original_value   | Original value before rounding                          | Double               |
| rounded_value    | Rounded value after applying rounding logic           | Double               |
| rounding_mode   | Rounding mode used (up, down, half-up)                  | String               |
| decimal_places  | Number of decimal places used for rounding             | Integer              |
| source_system    | System from which the data originated                | String               |
| timestamp        | Timestamp of the rounding operation                      | Timestamp            |
| difference       | Difference between original and rounded value (optional) | Double               |

**Note:**

* This is a sample structure, and you might need to adjust it based on specific requirements.
* Consider adding additional fields like user ID for audit purposes.

This approach provides a well-structured, maintainable, and cost-effective solution for consistent data rounding in Java. It addresses the challenges of Team Mercury and offers an audit trail for compliance needs.
