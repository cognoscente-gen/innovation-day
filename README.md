Here's why:

Double Precision: Doubles are stored in binary format with a limited number of bits for the significand (mantissa) and exponent. This limits their precision, especially for very small or large numbers.
Scientific Notation: When a double value falls outside the representable range, it's automatically converted to scientific notation internally. However, the number of significant figures displayed might not be exactly what you specify.
Alternatives:

String Formatting: As shown previously, you can use String.format to convert the double to a String representation with the desired scientific notation format and number of significant figures. This is a good approach for displaying the value in a human-readable format.

BigDecimal: If you need to perform calculations with these large or small values while maintaining some control over precision, consider using the BigDecimal class. It provides arbitrary precision decimal arithmetic but might be less efficient for large-scale calculations compared to doubles.


## Why displaying specific number formats can be tricky with computers

There are limitations to how computers represent and display numbers, especially for very small or large values. Here's a breakdown for both business and technical teams:

**For Business Teams:**

* Computers store numbers differently than we typically write them. This can affect how they're displayed.
* While we can usually see numbers like 2.50 or 2.61e-56, computers might struggle to represent them exactly due to internal storage limitations.
* Formatting tools can help display numbers in a more readable way, but they may not always match the exact format we desire.

**Technical Reasons:**

* **Double Data Type:** Commonly used for numerical calculations, doubles have a limited precision for storing numbers. This means they can't represent all possible values perfectly.
* **Scientific Notation:** When a double value falls outside the representable range, it's automatically converted to scientific notation internally. However, the number of significant figures displayed might not be controllable.
* **Formatting vs. Data Storage:** String formatting tools can help display numbers in a specific way, but this doesn't change how the underlying data is stored in the computer's memory.

**In Summary:**

* While we strive to display numbers accurately, there might be limitations due to computer data storage.
* Formatting tools can improve readability, but they may not always achieve the exact precision we want.

**Additional Notes:**

* This is a common challenge in computing, and there are ongoing efforts to develop more flexible number representation methods.
* For most calculations, doubles provide a good balance between performance and precision.
* If absolute precision is crucial, alternative data types like `BigDecimal` can be explored, but they might have performance trade-offs.
